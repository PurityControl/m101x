* Install MongoDB

The simplest way to install mongodb for development purposes is to [[https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#production][download]]
the mongodb tgz archive. There are options for all the major os / distros.

- Extract the archive
- Run mongod in the shell
  - this allows you to view logs easily and quit easily
- run a mongo shell in a second terminal
- you can make startup easier by adding the mongo bin directory to your path
  - you will then just have to type ~mongod~ or ~mongo~ to launch the database
    and shell respectively.
